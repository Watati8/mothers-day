    <h1>To My Sister 💐</h1>

    <p class="letter">
      Becoming a mom isn’t just about holding a baby in your arms—
      it’s learning to hold yourself together when no one sees the cracks.<br><br>
      It’s discovering strength you never knew you had,
      and stretching your heart in ways you never imagined.<br><br>
      <strong>I see you.</strong><br>
      The way you show up every day—
      even when you’re tired, sore, uncertain.<br>
      I see your love in the quiet moments,
      your courage in the chaos,
      your patience in the storm.<br><br>
      Your body, your mind, your world—
      they’ve all shifted.
      <strong>And still, you are blooming.</strong><br><br>
      So here’s to the late nights and the tiny triumphs,
      to the tears you’ve wiped (yours and hers),
      to the learning, the healing, and the growing.<br>
      You’re doing so well, even when it’s hard to believe it.<br><br>
      Your love is already shaping a whole new universe.
      And that? <strong>That’s power.</strong><br><br>
      <em>Happy Mother’s Day 💛</em><br>
