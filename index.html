    <h1>To My Beautiful Sister 💖</h1>
    <p class="letter">
      Becoming a mom isn’t just about holding a baby in your arms—
      it’s learning to hold yourself together when no one sees the cracks.
      It’s discovering strength you never knew you had,
      and stretching your heart in ways you never imagined.<br><br>

      I see you.<br>
      The way you show up every day—even when you’re tired, sore, uncertain.
      I see your love in the quiet moments,
      your courage in the chaos,
      your patience in the storm.<br><br>

      Your body, your mind, your world—they’ve all shifted.
      And still, you are blooming.<br><br>

      So here’s to the late nights and the tiny triumphs,
      to the tears you’ve wiped (yours and his),
      to the learning, the healing, and the growing.
      You’re doing so well, even when it’s hard to believe it.<br><br>

      Your love is already shaping a whole new universe.
      And that? That’s power.<br><br>

      Happy Mother’s Day 💛<br>
      With all my love,<br>
      Valentine
    </p>
