      <h2>For My Birth Mom</h2>
      <p>
        You’ve faced storms most people wouldn’t survive—and still, you smiled for me.<br><br>
        Since I was 17, we’ve been growing up together in our own way, and I’ve watched you fight, heal, and love with a softness that’s unmatched.<br><br>
        Thank you for the kind of love that speaks even when no words are said. I’ll carry that with me forever.

      <h2>For My Aunt (My Bonus Mom)</h2>
      <p>
        You didn’t have to—but you did.<br><br>
        You fed me, housed me, protected me, and never once made me feel like a burden. That kind of love is sacred.<br><br>
        Thank you for showing me that family is built by heart, not just blood. I hope you know just how deeply you are appreciated.
