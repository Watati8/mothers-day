    <h2>Dear Sister,</h2>
      <p>
      Becoming a mom isn’t just about holding a baby in your arms—<br />
      it’s learning to hold yourself together when no one sees the cracks.<br />
      It’s discovering strength you never knew you had,<br />
      and stretching your heart in ways you never imagined.<br /><br />

      I see you.<br />
      The way you show up every day—<br />
      even when you’re tired, sore, uncertain.<br />
      I see your love in the quiet moments,<br />
      your courage in the chaos,<br />
      your patience in the storm.<br /><br />

      Your body, your mind, your world—<br />
      they’ve all shifted.<br />
      And still, you are blooming.<br /><br />

      So here’s to the late nights and the tiny triumphs,<br />
      to the tears you’ve wiped (yours and his),<br />
      to the learning, the healing, and the growing.<br />
      You’re doing so well, even when it’s hard to believe it.<br /><br />

      Your love is already shaping a whole new universe.<br />
      And that? That’s power.<br /><br />

      Happy Mother’s Day 💛<br />
      With all my love,<br />
      Valentine N❤️
