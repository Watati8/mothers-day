    <p>
      You’ve faced storms most people wouldn’t survive—and still, you smiled for me.<br><br>
      Since I was 17, we’ve been growing up together in our own way, and I’ve watched you fight, heal, and love with a softness that’s unmatched.<br><br>
      Thank you for the kind of love that speaks even when no words are said.  
      I’ll carry that with me forever.
