    <p>Home is where your heart made room for me.</p>

    <p>
      You didn’t have to—but you did.<br><br>
      You fed me, housed me, protected me, and never once made me feel like a burden. That kind of love is sacred.<br><br>
      Thank you for showing me that family is built by heart, not just blood.  
      I hope you know just how deeply you are appreciated.
